Classes: can be defined as building blocks. There are others, as interfaces, records and enums.
Fields and methods: the primary elements of a class. They can be called members of a class.
Comments: helps with the readability of the code. We can use 3 types: single-line, multiple-line and the Javadoc one.

Main method = allows JVM to call and execute our code.

Commands:
javac: used to compile java classes and transform them into bytecode. We need to inform the file and the .java extension.
java: used to execute the compiled .class file. We must inform just the name of the file without the .class extension.
To be executed, the class must have a valid main() method.
A shortcut for both commands is java Zoo.java Zoo Bronks, where Zoo and Bronks are arguments. It's used when your program is only
one file.

Imports:
-we can use wildcards (*) to import all classes in the package (it doesn't bring child packages, fields or methods).
-java.lang package is always imported implicitly. So you can type, but you don't have to.
-if a class can be found in multiple packages, Java gives you a compile error. To solve it, we must remove one of the imports
or we must explicitly import a class name. This way, it takes precedence over any wildcard present.
-if both classes with the same name are needed, we must use it with fully qualified class name (with full package and class name).

Compile
-we can use wildcards (*) to compile all java files in a directory. I.E.: javac packagea/*.java
It just works for files, not directories.
-by default, when you compile a java file, the compiled classes are placed in the same directory. To
put them in a different directory, you can inform the option -d. I.E.: javac -d classes packagea/ClassA.java , where the compiled classes are going to be placed in classes/packagea
-to run the program, we must specify the classpath so Java knows where to find the classes. We can use the option -cp, -classpath or --class-path. I.E.: java -cp classes packagea.ClassA
-we can use the classpath option to specify the location of files explicitly. This is useful when the class files are located elsewhere or in special JAR files. I.E.: java -cp ".;C:\temp\someOtherLocation;c:\temp\myJar.jar" myPackage.MyClass
The period (.) indicates you want to include the current directory in the classpath

Creating a JAR file:
jar -cvf myNewFile.jar .
jar --create --verbose --file myNewFile.jar .
jar -cvf myNewFile.jar -C dir . (-C: specify directory containing files to be used to create the JAR)

Ordering elements in a class:
1) package declaration
2) imports statement
3) top-level type declaration
4) field declarations
5) method declarations

Following the order of the initialization
-Fields and instance initializer blocks are run in the order in whic they appear in the file;
-The constructor runs after all fields and instance intializer blocks have run;
-You can't refer to a variable before it has been defined;

Data Types
-Primitives: boolean, byte, short, int, long, float, double, char;
-When a number is present in the code, it's called literal.
-You can change the "base" when writing numbers. Examples would be binary, octal and hexadecimal (hexadecimal is case insensitive);
-You can have underscore in numbers to make them easier to read, it just can't be used at the beginning, at the end and with the decimal point;
-Wrapper classes (Boolean, Byte, Integer and so on) extend the Number class;

Defining Text blocks
-we can use the escape characters because backslash provides a special meaning in text, but it's harder to read;
-Text blocks (or multiline strings) are better. We define like this: """ (to start the text block) and """ (to end it). All identation and spaces are considered (if it's not at the end of line);
-Text blocks require a line break after the opening """.
-The \ omits the new line in the block. When it comes followed by other things as ", it's printed out;

Declaring variables
-An identifier is the name of a variable, method, class, interface or package;
-Identifiers must begin with a letter, a currency symbol or a _ symbol;
-Identifiers cam include numbers, but not start with them;
-A single underscore is not allowed as an identifier;
-You cannot use the same name as a Java reserved word;
