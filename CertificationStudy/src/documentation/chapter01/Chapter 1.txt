Classes: can be defined as building blocks. There are others, as interfaces, records and enums.
Fields and methods: the primary elements of a class. They can be called members of a class.
Comments: helps with the readability of the code. We can use 3 types: single-line, multiple-line and the Javadoc one.

Main method = allows JVM to call and execute our code.

Commands:
javac: used to compile java classes and transform them into bytecode. We need to inform the file and the .java extension.
java: used to execute the compiled .class file. We must inform just the name of the file without the .class extension.
To be executed, the class must have a valid main() method.
A shortcut for both commands is java Zoo.java Zoo Bronks, where Zoo and Bronks are arguments. It's used when your program is only
one file.
